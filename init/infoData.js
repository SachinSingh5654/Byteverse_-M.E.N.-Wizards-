      suffix: "Coronary Artery Disease",
      disease_name: "Heart",
      overview: "Coronary artery disease develops when the major blood vessels supplying the heart become damaged or diseased, typically due to cholesterol-containing deposits called plaques. These plaques narrow the arteries, reducing blood flow to the heart muscle. The condition progresses over decades and is the most common type of heart disease worldwide, often leading to angina or heart attacks when blood flow becomes severely restricted.",
      warning_signs: "The most concerning warning signs include chest pain or discomfort (angina) that may feel like pressure, squeezing, or fullness in the center of the chest. This pain may radiate to the arms, neck, jaw, or back. Other red flags include shortness of breath during routine activities, unusual fatigue with exertion, dizziness, cold sweats, and nausea. Women may experience more subtle symptoms like indigestion or back pain rather than classic chest discomfort.",
      common_symptoms: "Patients typically experience stable angina - predictable chest discomfort triggered by physical activity or emotional stress that subsides with rest. As the disease progresses, symptoms may include palpitations (irregular heartbeats), reduced exercise tolerance, sleep disturbances, and general fatigue. Some patients develop arrhythmias that cause fluttering sensations in the chest. Nocturnal angina (chest pain at night) indicates more advanced disease. Silent ischemia occurs when patients experience reduced blood flow without pain, particularly common in diabetics.",
      risk_factors: "Major modifiable risk factors include smoking (which damages artery linings), high blood pressure (forces arteries to work harder), high cholesterol (contributes to plaque formation), diabetes (elevated blood sugar damages vessels), obesity (especially abdominal fat), physical inactivity, and chronic stress. Non-modifiable factors include age (risk increases after 45 for men, 55 for women), male gender, family history of early heart disease, and postmenopausal status in women. Emerging research highlights additional risks from sleep apnea, chronic inflammation, and air pollution exposure.",
      complications: "The most severe complication is myocardial infarction (heart attack) when a coronary artery becomes completely blocked, causing permanent heart muscle damage. Heart failure may develop as the weakened heart cannot pump efficiently. Dangerous arrhythmias like ventricular fibrillation can lead to sudden cardiac arrest. Chronic reduced blood flow may cause cardiogenic shock where the heart cannot supply enough blood to vital organs. Other complications include stroke from dislodged plaques, peripheral artery disease, aneurysm formation, and depression due to chronic illness and activity limitations.",
      diagnostic_tests: "Initial evaluation includes a detailed medical history and physical examination. Electrocardiogram (ECG) detects abnormal heart rhythms and evidence of past heart attacks. Stress testing (treadmill or pharmacological) monitors heart function during exertion. Echocardiography uses ultrasound to assess heart structure and pumping ability. Coronary CT angiography provides detailed 3D images of the arteries. Invasive coronary angiography remains the gold standard, where a catheter injects contrast dye into the arteries while X-rays visualize blockages. Blood tests measure cardiac enzymes during acute events and assess cholesterol levels, inflammation markers, and other risk factors.",
      treatment_options: "Treatment focuses on three main goals: relieving symptoms, slowing disease progression, and preventing complications. Lifestyle modifications form the foundation, including smoking cessation, adopting a heart-healthy diet (Mediterranean style), and regular aerobic exercise. Medications manage risk factors: statins lower cholesterol, beta-blockers reduce heart workload, ACE inhibitors lower blood pressure, and antiplatelet drugs (aspirin) prevent clot formation. For acute symptoms, nitroglycerin dilates coronary arteries. Procedures include angioplasty with stent placement to open blocked arteries and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) using healthy vessels to create new pathways around blockages. Cardiac rehabilitation programs combine supervised exercise with education for optimal recovery.",
      medications: "First-line medications include high-intensity statins (atorvastatin 40-80mg daily) to aggressively lower LDL cholesterol. Beta-blockers (metoprolol, carvedilol) decrease heart rate and blood pressure. ACE inhibitors (lisinopril, ramipril) or ARBs protect blood vessels from further damage. Daily low-dose aspirin (81mg) or clopidogrel helps prevent blood clots. Nitrates (nitroglycerin) provide rapid symptom relief during angina episodes. For acute coronary events, stronger antiplatelets (ticagrelor) and anticoagulants (heparin) are used temporarily. Additional medications may include calcium channel blockers (amlodipine) for vasodilation, ranolazine for chronic angina, and newer agents like PCSK9 inhibitors for stubborn high cholesterol.",
      home_remedies: "Dietary approaches emphasize plant-based foods rich in fiber (oats, beans, lentils), omega-3 fatty acids (salmon, walnuts, flaxseeds), and antioxidants (berries, dark leafy greens). The Mediterranean diet pattern has shown particular cardiovascular benefits. Regular physical activity (150 minutes per week of moderate exercise) improves circulation - walking, swimming and cycling are excellent choices. Stress management through meditation, deep breathing exercises, and yoga helps lower blood pressure naturally. Smoking cessation is absolutely critical - combining nicotine replacement therapies with counseling significantly improves success rates. Weight loss of just 5-10% of body weight can substantially reduce cardiac workload. Home blood pressure monitoring helps track progress between doctor visits.",
      when_to_see_doctor: "Seek immediate emergency care for chest pain lasting more than 5 minutes, especially if accompanied by sweating, nausea, or shortness of breath - these may indicate a heart attack. Schedule urgent evaluation for new or worsening chest discomfort, unexplained fatigue with routine activities, or swelling in the legs/feet. Regular follow-ups are essential if you have risk factors like diabetes or family history of heart disease. Annual checkups should include blood pressure measurement, cholesterol screening (starting at age 20 for those with risk factors), and diabetes testing if overweight. Those with diagnosed CAD need regular cardiologist supervision for medication adjustments and disease progression monitoring.",
      preventive_measures: "Primary prevention focuses on controlling modifiable risk factors beginning in young adulthood. The American Heart Association recommends: 1) A diet rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains and lean proteins 2) At least 150 minutes weekly of moderate exercise 3) Complete smoking avoidance 4) Maintaining a healthy weight (BMI 18.5-24.9) 5) Keeping blood pressure below 120/80 mmHg 6) Total cholesterol under 200 mg/dL 7) Blood sugar control (fasting glucose <100 mg/dL) 8) Quality sleep (7-9 hours nightly). Secondary prevention for those with existing CAD adds daily low-dose aspirin (when appropriate), annual flu vaccination, and formal cardiac rehabilitation. Community-level measures like smoking bans, urban green spaces for exercise, and workplace wellness programs contribute to population-wide prevention.",
      prognosis: "With contemporary treatments and lifestyle modifications, most CAD patients can effectively manage symptoms and maintain good quality of life. The 10-year survival rate exceeds 80% with proper treatment adherence. Positive prognostic factors include early diagnosis, complete smoking cessation, achieving LDL cholesterol below 70 mg/dL, excellent blood pressure control, and regular physical activity. Poorer outcomes associate with multi-vessel disease, reduced heart function (ejection fraction <40%), diabetes mellitus, and continued smoking. After revascularization procedures, about 20% of patients require repeat interventions within 10 years. Psychological factors significantly impact outcomes - depression and social isolation correlate with worse prognosis. Participation in structured cardiac rehabilitation programs reduces mortality by 20-30% and should be considered standard of care."

      suffix: "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease",
      disease_name: " Lungs",
      overview: "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressive inflammatory lung disease characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation due to abnormalities in the airways and/or alveoli. The condition primarily encompasses two main phenotypes: chronic bronchitis (inflammation and mucus production in the airways) and emphysema (destruction of alveolar walls). Most cases result from long-term exposure to noxious particles, especially cigarette smoke, although environmental pollutants and genetic factors (alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency) also contribute. COPD develops slowly over years and typically becomes clinically apparent after age 40. The disease causes significant morbidity worldwide and is currently the third leading cause of death globally.",
      warning_signs: "Early warning signs include a chronic cough often dismissed as 'smoker's cough,' increased mucus production (especially in mornings), wheezing sounds during breathing, and shortness of breath initially noticeable only during physical exertion. As the disease progresses, patients may experience frequent respiratory infections, unexplained weight loss, morning headaches (from overnight oxygen deprivation), and swelling in the ankles/feet (indicating right heart strain). Advanced warning signs include bluish discoloration of lips/fingernails (cyanosis), use of accessory breathing muscles, and inability to complete full sentences without pausing for breath. Acute exacerbations marked by sudden worsening of symptoms represent medical emergencies requiring prompt attention.",
      common_symptoms: "The hallmark symptom is progressive dyspnea (shortness of breath) that worsens over time, initially with exertion but eventually occurring at rest. Patients typically develop a chronic productive cough with thick sputum, often worst in mornings. Wheezing and chest tightness are common, especially during exacerbations. As the disease advances, systemic symptoms emerge including fatigue, unintended weight loss (from increased work of breathing), muscle wasting, and exercise intolerance. Many patients experience anxiety and depression related to breathlessness and reduced quality of life. Sleep disturbances are prevalent due to coughing and oxygen desaturation. During exacerbations (often triggered by infections), symptoms dramatically worsen with increased dyspnea, purulent sputum, and sometimes respiratory failure requiring hospitalization.",
      risk_factors: "The primary risk factor is tobacco smoking (including secondhand exposure), accounting for 85-90% of cases in developed countries. Other significant risks include long-term exposure to indoor air pollution (biomass fuels in poorly ventilated homes), occupational dusts/chemicals (coal mining, textile work), and outdoor air pollution. Genetic factors play a role, particularly alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (a protein that protects lung tissue). Additional risks include childhood respiratory infections, asthma (especially when combined with smoking), low socioeconomic status, and advancing age. Emerging research suggests dietary factors (low antioxidant intake), recurrent pneumonia, and possibly certain viral infections may contribute to COPD development. The disease shows a slight male predominance historically, though rates in women are rising with increased smoking prevalence.",
      complications: "Acute exacerbations (sudden symptom worsening) often require hospitalization and accelerate lung function decline. Respiratory infections (pneumonia, influenza) pose serious risks due to compromised lung defenses. Pulmonary hypertension develops as damaged lung vessels increase resistance, eventually causing right heart failure (cor pulmonale). Chronic hypoxemia leads to secondary polycythemia (increased red blood cells) and cognitive impairment. Osteoporosis and muscle wasting result from systemic inflammation and reduced activity. Anxiety and depression are common due to chronic breathlessness and lifestyle limitations. The economic burden is substantial, including direct medical costs and lost productivity from disability. End-stage COPD patients may require long-term oxygen therapy or lung transplantation, with overall reduced life expectancy compared to healthy individuals.",
      diagnostic_tests: "Spirometry is the gold standard diagnostic test, showing persistent airflow limitation (FEV1/FVC ratio <0.70 post-bronchodilator). The test measures forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to stage disease severity. Chest X-rays help exclude other conditions and may show hyperinflation/flattened diaphragms. CT scans better characterize emphysema distribution and detect comorbidities. Arterial blood gases assess oxygenation and carbon dioxide retention in advanced disease. Alpha-1 antitrypsin level testing identifies genetic deficiency. Six-minute walk tests evaluate functional capacity. Pulse oximetry monitors oxygen saturation. Sputum analysis helps identify infection during exacerbations. Complete blood count may show polycythemia from chronic hypoxemia. Echocardiography evaluates pulmonary hypertension and right heart function in advanced cases.",
      treatment_options: "Smoking cessation is the single most effective intervention to slow progression. Bronchodilators (short- and long-acting) relieve symptoms by opening airways: beta-agonists (albuterol, salmeterol) and anticholinergics (ipratropium, tiotropium). Inhaled corticosteroids reduce exacerbation frequency in certain patients. Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors (roflumilast) decrease inflammation in chronic bronchitis. Oxygen therapy improves survival in hypoxemic patients. Pulmonary rehabilitation programs combine exercise training, education, and nutrition counseling. Vaccinations (pneumococcal, influenza) prevent triggering infections. For severe cases, surgical options include lung volume reduction surgery or transplantation. Exacerbations require prompt treatment with antibiotics (if infection suspected), systemic corticosteroids, and increased bronchodilator use. Non-invasive ventilation supports breathing during severe exacerbations.",
      medications: "First-line maintenance therapies include long-acting bronchodilators: LAMAs (tiotropium, umeclidinium) and LABAs (salmeterol, formoterol), often combined in single inhalers. Inhaled corticosteroids (fluticasone, budesonide) are added for patients with frequent exacerbations. Triple therapy inhalers (LAMA/LABA/ICS) like trelegy optimize treatment for advanced disease. Short-acting bronchodilators (albuterol, ipratropium) provide rescue relief. Oral theophylline may be considered when inhalers are insufficient. Roflumilast (PDE4 inhibitor) reduces exacerbations in chronic bronchitis phenotype. Azithromycin (three times weekly) decreases exacerbations in select patients. Mucolytics (carbocisteine) may help those with thick secretions. During exacerbations, prednisone (40mg daily for 5 days) and antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanate, doxycycline) are commonly prescribed based on symptom severity and sputum characteristics.",
      home_remedies: "Pursed-lip breathing techniques help relieve dyspnea during activities. Diaphragmatic breathing exercises strengthen respiratory muscles. Air purifiers reduce indoor irritants. Maintaining good hydration thins mucus secretions. A balanced diet with adequate protein prevents muscle wasting. Gentle regular exercise (as tolerated) preserves function - walking is ideal. Elevating the head during sleep eases nighttime breathing. Steam inhalation (with caution) may loosen secretions. Avoiding extreme temperatures and high altitudes prevents symptom flares. Creating an action plan with the doctor helps manage exacerbations early. Joining support groups addresses emotional aspects. Installing grab bars and shower chairs prevents falls during breathlessness. Pulse oximeters help monitor oxygen levels at home. Portable oxygen concentrators enable mobility for those requiring oxygen therapy.",
      when_to_see_doctor: "Seek immediate care for severe shortness of breath at rest, confusion/drowsiness, blue lips/fingernails, or rapid heartbeat - these indicate respiratory failure. Schedule urgent evaluation for increased sputum volume/color change, worsening cough, unexplained weight loss, or swelling in legs. Regular follow-ups are needed to monitor lung function decline (at least annually for stable patients). Pulmonary specialists should manage moderate-severe COPD. Emergency care is required during exacerbations with marked symptom worsening. Vaccinations should be updated annually (flu) and as recommended (pneumococcal). Consider palliative care consultation for advanced disease to discuss goals of care. Early discussion about advanced directives is advisable given the progressive nature of COPD.",
      preventive_measures: "Smoking prevention/cessation is paramount - even late quitting slows decline. Avoiding secondhand smoke and occupational/environmental pollutants reduces risk. Yearly influenza vaccines and periodic pneumococcal vaccines prevent triggering infections. Regular moderate exercise maintains respiratory muscle strength. Good nutrition prevents muscle wasting and supports immunity. Indoor air quality improvements (ventilation, air filters) help, especially in biomass-exposed populations. Early treatment of respiratory infections prevents lung damage. Genetic counseling/testing is advised for those with family history of early COPD or alpha-1 deficiency. For workers in high-risk occupations, proper protective equipment and regular spirometry monitoring are essential. Public health measures like clean air policies and tobacco control laws reduce population-level risk.",
      prognosis: "COPD is generally progressive, though the rate varies significantly among individuals. The BODE index (incorporating BMI, airflow Obstruction, Dyspnea, and Exercise capacity) helps predict mortality. Average 5-year survival ranges from 40-70% depending on disease severity at diagnosis. Smoking cessation at any stage improves prognosis - quitters show slower FEV1 decline (about half the rate of continuing smokers). Frequent exacerbations (≥2/year) accelerate lung function loss and worsen outcomes. Patients requiring long-term oxygen therapy have reduced life expectancy. Comorbidities (especially cardiovascular disease) significantly impact prognosis. Pulmonary rehabilitation improves quality of life and exercise tolerance. While no cure exists, comprehensive management can stabilize symptoms and prolong functional capacity. End-stage patients may consider palliative care focusing on symptom relief and quality of life."

      suffix: "Cirrhosis",
      disease_name: "Liver",
      overview: "Cirrhosis represents the end-stage of chronic liver disease, characterized by widespread fibrosis and the formation of regenerative nodules that disrupt normal liver architecture and function. This irreversible scarring results from long-term liver injury due to various causes including chronic viral hepatitis, alcohol abuse, fatty liver disease, autoimmune conditions, and genetic disorders. The damaged liver tissue becomes nodular and stiff, leading to portal hypertension and eventual liver failure. Cirrhosis develops gradually over years to decades, often remaining asymptomatic until advanced stages. It affects about 1 in 400 adults in developed countries and carries significant morbidity and mortality, with complications accounting for over 1 million deaths annually worldwide.",
      warning_signs: "Early warning signs are often subtle and nonspecific: chronic fatigue, mild abdominal discomfort, and unexplained weight loss. As the disease progresses, more specific signs emerge including jaundice (yellowing of skin/eyes), pruritus (itchy skin from bile salt accumulation), and spider angiomas (small, spider-like blood vessels on the skin). Easy bruising/bleeding (from decreased clotting factors), palmar erythema (reddened palms), and gynecomastia (in men) suggest advancing disease. Mental confusion or personality changes may indicate hepatic encephalopathy. Dark urine and clay-colored stools signal biliary dysfunction. Abdominal swelling from ascites typically appears in decompensated cirrhosis.",
      common_symptoms: "Compensated cirrhosis may be asymptomatic or cause only mild fatigue, nausea, and poor appetite. Decompensated cirrhosis presents with more severe manifestations: ascites (abdominal fluid accumulation causing distension), peripheral edema (leg swelling), gastrointestinal bleeding from esophageal varices, and hepatic encephalopathy (confusion, sleep disturbances, coma). Jaundice becomes pronounced as liver function declines. Patients often experience muscle wasting and weakness. Pruritus can be severe and refractory to treatment. Endocrine abnormalities include loss of libido and menstrual irregularities. Portal hypertension leads to splenomegaly (enlarged spleen) and collateral vein development visible as caput medusae around the umbilicus. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is a life-threatening complication of ascites.",
      risk_factors: "Chronic excessive alcohol consumption (typically >3 drinks/day for men, >2 for women over 10+ years) is a major cause. Viral hepatitis (especially HCV and HBV) accounts for many cases worldwide. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), associated with obesity/metabolic syndrome, is increasingly prevalent. Other causes include autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, hemochromatosis (iron overload), Wilson's disease (copper accumulation), and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Chronic biliary obstruction (gallstones, strictures) can lead to secondary biliary cirrhosis. Certain medications (methotrexate, amiodarone) and toxins contribute to risk. Male gender and older age increase susceptibility to alcohol-related cirrhosis. Coexisting conditions like HIV or schistosomiasis accelerate progression.",
      complications: "Portal hypertension leads to life-threatening variceal bleeding and ascites. Hepatic encephalopathy ranges from mild confusion to coma. Hepatorenal syndrome (kidney failure) carries high mortality. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is a deadly infection of ascitic fluid. Hepatopulmonary syndrome causes oxygenation problems. Liver cancer (HCC) develops in 3-5% of cirrhotics annually. Malnutrition results from impaired protein synthesis and poor intake. Osteoporosis is common due to vitamin D metabolism disruption. Coagulopathy increases bleeding risks. The economic burden is substantial, with frequent hospitalizations and often need for transplantation. Psychosocial impacts include depression, anxiety, and reduced quality of life. End-stage patients face difficult decisions regarding life support and palliative care.",
      diagnostic_tests: "Liver function tests show elevated bilirubin, AST/ALT (often AST>ALT in alcohol-related), alkaline phosphatase, and prolonged PT/INR. Complete blood count may reveal thrombocytopenia from splenomegaly. Albumin levels decrease as synthetic function fails. Viral hepatitis serologies identify infectious causes. Ferritin/iron studies assess for hemochromatosis. Ceruloplasmin tests for Wilson's disease. Autoantibodies help diagnose autoimmune hepatitis/PBC. Ultrasound detects nodular liver, ascites, and HCC screening. Transient elastography (FibroScan) measures liver stiffness noninvasively. MRI/CT provide detailed imaging of liver structure. Upper endoscopy evaluates for varices. Liver biopsy remains gold standard for staging fibrosis but is often unnecessary when clinical/imaging findings are clear. MELD score (based on bilirubin, creatinine, INR) predicts mortality and transplant priority.",
      treatment_options: "Management focuses on treating the underlying cause (antivirals for hepatitis, abstinence for alcohol-related), preventing complications, and considering transplantation for eligible patients. Diuretics (spironolactone, furosemide) manage ascites/edema. Beta-blockers (propranolol, nadolol) prevent variceal bleeding. Lactulose/rifaximin treat/prevent encephalopathy. Nutritional support combats malnutrition. Regular endoscopic surveillance detects/treats varices. Paracentesis relieves tense ascites with albumin infusion to prevent circulatory dysfunction. TIPS procedure (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) reduces portal hypertension in select cases. Liver transplantation is definitive treatment for eligible patients with decompensated disease. Palliative approaches focus on symptom control in end-stage disease. Emerging antifibrotic therapies aim to slow/halt fibrosis progression but remain experimental.",
      medications: "Disease-specific treatments include antivirals (sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for HCV, entecavir/tenofovir for HBV), ursodeoxycholic acid/obeticholic acid for PBC, and immunosuppressants (prednisone, azathioprine) for autoimmune hepatitis. For complications: propranolol/nadolol for variceal prophylaxis, lactulose (30mL titrated to 2-3 soft stools/day) for encephalopathy, rifaximin (550mg twice daily) as add-on therapy. Diuretics include spironolactone (100-400mg daily) and furosemide (20-160mg daily) for ascites. Antibiotics (norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin) prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in high-risk patients. Zinc supplementation helps with encephalopathy and wound healing. Pain management requires caution with opioids/NSAIDs due to metabolism issues. Proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole) reduce ulcer risk but may increase infection risk.",
      home_remedies: "Complete alcohol abstinence is critical for all causes of cirrhosis. Low-sodium diet (<2000mg/day) reduces fluid retention. High-protein intake (1.2-1.5g/kg/day) prevents muscle wasting, reduced if encephalopathy occurs. Small frequent meals help with early satiety from ascites. Milk thistle (silymarin) may offer mild benefits but evidence is limited. Coffee consumption (2-3 cups/day) associates with slower fibrosis progression. Skin care with moisturizers and cool baths alleviates pruritus. Exercise as tolerated preserves muscle mass. Fluid restriction (<1.5L/day) may be needed with severe hyponatremia. Soft toothbrushes and electric razors minimize bleeding risks. Fall prevention measures are essential due to fracture risks from osteoporosis. Caregiver education about encephalopathy signs enables early intervention.",
      when_to_see_doctor: "Seek immediate care for vomiting blood, black/tarry stools, confusion, or fever - these indicate life-threatening complications. Schedule urgent evaluation for new/worsening abdominal swelling, increased jaundice, or weight loss. Regular follow-ups (every 3-6 months for stable compensated cirrhosis) monitor for progression. Gastroenterologists/hepatologists should manage decompensated disease. Surveillance ultrasound/alpha-fetoprotein every 6 months screens for HCC. Endoscopic variceal surveillance depends on initial findings. Mental status changes require prompt assessment for encephalopathy. Nutritional consultations help address deficiencies. Early transplant center referral is advisable for eligible patients. Palliative care involvement benefits those with advanced disease focusing on symptom management and advance care planning.",
      preventive_measures: "Vaccination against hepatitis A/B prevents additional liver damage. Moderate alcohol consumption or complete avoidance prevents alcohol-related cirrhosis. Healthy weight maintenance through diet/exercise prevents NAFLD progression. Proper diabetes control reduces metabolic liver injury. Safe injection practices and barrier protection prevent viral hepatitis transmission. Regular monitoring of patients with chronic hepatitis or fatty liver enables early intervention. Avoidance of hepatotoxins (certain herbs, excessive acetaminophen) protects the liver. Genetic counseling/testing identifies inheritable conditions early. Public health measures like clean needle programs and alcohol control policies reduce population-level risk. Education about cirrhosis signs promotes early diagnosis when interventions can still slow progression.",
      prognosis: "Prognosis varies by stage - compensated cirrhosis has median survival of 12+ years, while decompensated disease shows 2-year mortality of 50% without transplant. The Child-Pugh and MELD scores help predict outcomes. Positive prognostic factors include early diagnosis, cause-specific treatment (e.g., HCV cure), abstinence from alcohol, and complication prevention. Negative indicators include variceal bleeding, refractory ascites, hepatorenal syndrome, and HCC development. Liver transplantation offers excellent outcomes (5-year survival >70%) for eligible candidates. Quality of life often declines as disease progresses, with frequent hospitalizations in later stages. Palliative approaches improve symptom control and end-of-life care. Emerging therapies targeting fibrosis pathways may eventually alter the natural history of cirrhosis."

      suffix: "Mellitus Type 2",
      disease_name: "Diabetes",
      overview: "Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion, leading to elevated blood glucose levels. The condition develops when the body cannot effectively use insulin or when pancreatic beta cells fail to produce enough insulin. Over time, persistent hyperglycemia damages blood vessels and nerves, contributing to systemic complications affecting multiple organ systems.",
      warning_signs: "Early warning signs include excessive thirst (polydipsia), frequent urination (polyuria), and unexplained fatigue. More concerning symptoms include blurred vision, slow-healing wounds (especially in feet), recurrent infections, and sudden weight loss despite normal or increased appetite. Tingling or numbness in hands/feet may indicate developing neuropathy.",
      common_symptoms: "Patients often experience increased hunger (polyphagia), dry mouth, and itchy skin. Women may notice frequent yeast infections. Many report a 'brain fog' or difficulty concentrating when blood sugar fluctuates. Some develop acanthosis nigricans - dark, velvety skin patches in body folds. Nocturia (frequent nighttime urination) commonly disrupts sleep patterns.",
      risk_factors: "Major risk factors include obesity (especially abdominal fat), physical inactivity, and prediabetes. Family history increases risk significantly. Ethnicity plays a role (higher prevalence in African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans). Other risks: gestational diabetes history, PCOS, hypertension, HDL cholesterol <35 mg/dL, or triglycerides >250 mg/dL. Age >45 years elevates risk, though onset is occurring younger recently.",
      complications: "Acute complications include dangerous hypoglycemia from medications and hyperglycemic crises (HHS or DKA). Chronic complications involve microvascular damage (retinopathy leading to blindness, nephropathy causing kidney failure, neuropathy with foot ulcers) and macrovascular effects (accelerated atherosclerosis, increased heart attack/stroke risk). Other complications: gastroparesis, sexual dysfunction, depression, and increased susceptibility to infections.",
      diagnostic_tests: "Diagnosis relies on blood tests: fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL, HbA1c ≥6.5%, or random glucose ≥200 mg/dL with symptoms. Oral glucose tolerance testing may be used. Ongoing monitoring includes quarterly HbA1c tests, annual comprehensive foot exams, yearly dilated eye exams, and regular urine albumin screening for kidney damage. Continuous glucose monitors provide real-time glycemic data.",
      treatment_options: "First-line treatment combines lifestyle modification (diet, exercise, weight loss) with metformin. Additional medications may include SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, or insulin therapy for advanced cases. Bariatric surgery benefits some obese patients. Treatment aims for individualized glycemic targets (usually HbA1c <7%) while avoiding hypoglycemia. Comprehensive care addresses blood pressure (<130/80 mmHg) and cholesterol management.",
      medications: "Metformin remains first-line (500-2000 mg daily). Other options: sulfonylureas (glipizide), DPP-4 inhibitors (sitagliptin), SGLT2 inhibitors (empagliflozin), GLP-1 agonists (liraglutide), and various insulin regimens (basal/bolus). Statins are often prescribed for cardiovascular protection. ACE inhibitors/ARBs protect kidneys even in normotensive patients.",
      home_remedies: "Dietary focus on low-glycemic foods, portion control, and carbohydrate counting. Regular aerobic and resistance exercise improves insulin sensitivity. Stress reduction techniques help manage cortisol-related glucose spikes. Home glucose monitoring guides daily decisions. Foot care includes daily inspection and proper footwear. Alcohol moderation is essential to prevent hypoglycemia.",
      when_to_see_doctor: "Seek immediate care for confusion/lethargy with very high glucose (>300 mg/dL) or moderate ketones in urine. Schedule urgent visits for recurrent hypoglycemia, persistent hyperglycemia despite medication, or new numbness/vision changes. Annual comprehensive exams should include kidney function tests, lipid panels, and dilated retinal exams.",
      preventive_measures: "Prediabetes management can prevent or delay progression. Weight loss of 5-7% reduces risk. The Diabetes Prevention Program highlights 150 mins/week exercise and dietary changes. Smoking cessation is critical. Regular screening begins at age 45 (earlier with risk factors). Community programs promoting healthy food access and safe exercise spaces help population-level prevention.",
      prognosis: "With tight glycemic control and risk factor management, many live decades without major complications. HbA1c <7% reduces microvascular risk by 40%. Cardiovascular risk remains elevated even with good control. Life expectancy is reduced by ~10 years on average, but this gap narrows with optimal care. Early intensive intervention preserves beta-cell function longer."

      overview: "COPD is a progressive inflammatory lung disease characterized by persistent airflow limitation, typically caused by long-term exposure to noxious particles, most commonly cigarette smoke. The condition encompasses emphysema (alveolar destruction) and chronic bronchitis (airway inflammation). Pathological changes include airway remodeling, mucus hypersecretion, and loss of lung elasticity, leading to irreversible airflow obstruction and impaired gas exchange.",
      warning_signs: "Early red flags include a chronic 'smoker's cough' (often dismissed as normal), increased sputum production (especially morning), and subtle shortness of breath during routine activities. Progressive symptoms like wheezing, chest tightness, and frequent respiratory infections should prompt evaluation. Acute worsening (exacerbations) with severe dyspnea, purulent sputum, or cyanosis requires urgent care.",
      common_symptoms: "The hallmark triad includes dyspnea (worsening over years), chronic productive cough (typically mucoid sputum), and wheezing. Patients develop 'air trapping' causing barrel chest appearance. Advanced cases show pursed-lip breathing, use of accessory muscles, and chronic fatigue. Many experience weight loss ('pulmonary cachexia') and sleep disturbances due to hypoxia. Morning headaches may signal hypercapnia.",
      risk_factors: "Cigarette smoking (including secondhand) causes 80-90% of cases. Occupational exposures (coal dust, silica, cadmium). Biomass fuel exposure in poorly ventilated homes. Genetic factors (alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency in 1-2% of cases). Aging increases risk due to cumulative exposure. Childhood respiratory infections predispose to later COPD. Asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) represents a distinct phenotype.",
      complications: "Acute exacerbations (often infectious) accelerate lung function decline. Respiratory failure develops in advanced disease. Cor pulmonale (right heart failure from pulmonary hypertension). Pneumothorax risk increases with bullous emphysema. Secondary polycythemia from chronic hypoxia. Increased risk for lung cancer. Severe osteoporosis from chronic inflammation and steroid use. Depression/anxiety are prevalent due to activity limitations.",
      diagnostic_tests: "Spirometry is diagnostic (post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC <0.70). Chest X-ray shows hyperinflation, flattened diaphragms. CT scanning detects emphysema distribution. ABGs assess gas exchange in advanced disease. Alpha-1 antitrypsin testing in young-onset cases. 6-minute walk test evaluates functional capacity. BODE index (BMI, obstruction, dyspnea, exercise) predicts mortality.",
      treatment_options: "Smoking cessation is paramount. Bronchodilators (LAMA/LABA combinations) are mainstay treatments. Inhaled corticosteroids for frequent exacerbations. Pulmonary rehabilitation improves quality of life. Long-term oxygen if PaO2 ≤55 mmHg. Vaccinations (pneumococcal, annual influenza) are essential. Lung volume reduction surgery or transplantation in select cases. Palliative care approaches for advanced disease.",
      medications: "LAMAs (tiotropium), LABAs (salmeterol), and combination inhalers (umeclidinium/vilanterol). ICS/LABA combos (fluticasone/salmeterol) for exacerbation-prone patients. Roflumilast for chronic bronchitis phenotype. Theophylline in resource-limited settings. Azithromycin prophylaxis for frequent exacerbators. Mucolytics (carbocisteine) for viscous sputum. Short-acting bronchodilators (albuterol) for rescue therapy.",
      home_remedies: "Pursed-lip breathing techniques relieve dyspnea. Airway clearance devices (Acapella) help mucus removal. Energy conservation strategies during daily activities.

      overview: "RA is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease primarily causing symmetric inflammatory polyarthritis. The immune system mistakenly attacks synovial joints, leading to proliferative synovitis, cartilage destruction, and eventual bone erosion. Beyond joints, RA can affect multiple organ systems through inflammatory processes. Without treatment, progressive joint damage leads to significant disability and reduced quality of life.",
      warning_signs: "Early concerning signs include morning stiffness lasting >30 minutes, symmetric joint swelling (especially small joints of hands/feet), and fatigue out of proportion to activity. 'Alarm' symptoms include rapid joint deformity development, rheumatoid nodules, and systemic manifestations like pleuritic chest pain or dry eyes/mouth suggesting overlap syndromes.",
      common_symptoms: "Classic presentation involves painful, swollen PIP/MCP joints with warmth but minimal redness. Stiffness improves with activity but recurs after rest. Many experience prodromal symptoms like low-grade fever, weight loss, and generalized aching. Advanced disease causes characteristic deformities (ulnar deviation, swan neck/boutonniere deformities). Extra-articular manifestations include dry eyes (sicca syndrome), pulmonary nodules, and vasculitis.",
